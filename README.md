At this moment, my sweet baby boy Moon is making a lot of noise. He wants attention, and then he wants even more attention. There is not enough attention in the world to give to this cat.

I live in Brooklyn. I'm in Park Slope, which I really enjoy. I do not like follow-up questions, unless they are from my therapist. Then it's ok because I pay her. 
I learned way too late that you can push the window key and period at the same time to get an emoji. 📎is a classic. I use 🐈‍⬛ a lot to represent Moon.
